Crypto Project
===============
A simple project that is used to see if the a file has changed.  First, we create a private/public key.  The file is singed using the private key (the gui provided is used to accomplish this).  The public key is used to check to make sure that the file has not changed.  If the file has changed, an error message will appear.  If the file has not changed, then the user will be able to see the file.

See 'demo.doc' for more on how to use the application.
